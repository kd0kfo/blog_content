First Round of Soldering
=========================

The entire setup of the clock has been successfully prototyped. The PIC drives the LEDs quite well. So there is no need to use transistors to power those separately. Transistors will be used as switches to separate the binary from the hex/octal displays, as they will be operated with the same port on the PIC.

I am soldering in segments. I started with the binary LED section. There is an extra bit in the hour line. While soldering I forgot that I was looking at a backward image. So the LED's were lined up to the left, instead of the right. I made up for this by just adding an LED to the right. This will add an extra bit to the hour line, but that's no big deal.
