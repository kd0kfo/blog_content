General Code Style Guide
========================

About
-----

This style guide should apply to language-agnostic programming techniques and practices. For language-specific style, see the style guide for that specific language.

Case
----

For easy of reading, use underscores between words in a variable name. There is one exception to this and that is java. See Case in the Java Code Style Guide for details.

Version Numbers
---------------

* Format is MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION.

  * For a beta version, REVISION should always be "b". Otherwise, all three parts should be an integer.
  * REVISION should be incremented when things are fixed but a no new features are added.
  * MINOR should be incremented when at least one new feature is added.
  * MAJOR should be incremented when it is no longer compatable with past instances or if it has changed to a point so as not to be recognizable. This should **rarely** change.
