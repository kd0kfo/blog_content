When science goes bad: Strange Pictures
=========================================

Generally, a good way of understanding what is going on in a program is to represent data graphically. With my convolution program, I get a lot of strange looking images, which may or may not be what I was looking for. Here is one example:

In this picture, I was producing shear values through the convolution of an elliptical mass (as can be seen here) with a special function ;) . This is what came out of it. Of course this picture has been sitting in my temp directory for quite a while. So I have no idea what part of the whole situation it represents, but I thought it was amusing none the less.


Here is another example that I found sitting around:

I honestly have no idea what happened here; it's been so long. It is strange though... o.O
