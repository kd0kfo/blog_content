Skype
=====

Besides instant messaging, Skype [1]_ offers voice and video communications, as well as various games, such as chess and backgammon. The user interface is very easy to use.

Setup is pretty simple. After downloading the setup file, Skype leads you through prompts to setup up an account. It is free unless you call an actual telephone. Once the setup is finished you can find other users through the "Search for Skype Users..." dialog found in the "Tools" Menu.

Once a person is found, that person can be called by clicking the green telephone button. Also a text dialog can be started by clicking the "dialog bubble" button.
