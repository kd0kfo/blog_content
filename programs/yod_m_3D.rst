Yod'm 3D
=========

One thing windows lacks, compared to other OS's, is the capability to use multiple virtual desktops. There are applications to add this nicety. Yod'm 3D [#descr]_ takes it to a whole new level. Aside from providing 4 virtual desktops, Yod'm 3D uses a slick 3d cube that the user rotates to view and select other desktops. One thing about it though: it does take between 30-60 Meg of RAM. There is an option for it to give up memory when it's not in use, but that renders it quite slow.

Installation is extremely simple. Download the zip file and unzip it. It requires no installation and can run from the directory it is in.
