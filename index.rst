Blog of David Coss, PhD
=========================

Welcome to my redesigned Blog!

All of my original posts may be found under their respective categories. Category listing can be found here: http://blog.davecoss.com/cgi-bin/render.cgi

This is a very simple blog system I wrote in Python that uses reStructuredText. The source code is available at http://github.com/kd0kfo/blog . Also, links to the plain text source of each page may be found at the bottom, along with a category, if applicable.
