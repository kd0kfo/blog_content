Radio Programs
===============

I started a page for radio programs [1]_ that may come up with along the way. I made a PERL script to parse APRS packets. After that I realized I should make a page to store them.

This PERL script will read packets from the APRS.FI website. It breaks them up into three parts: date and time (UTC), the path and the message. There is a subroutine to do stuff with the packets. This should be the place to insert custom functions to do useful things with the packets' information.
