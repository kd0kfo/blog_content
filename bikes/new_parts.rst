New parts
=========

I finally got the bike in working order. After cleaning, this included new tires and chain. For tires I went with the smooth road tires. They first tried to sell me nubby mountain bike tires, but when I returned them for being the wrong size [#size]_, I went for the street tires. I think that is a better move, albeit a little more expensive. Inflated near 100psi, they're bumpier but less rolling friction.

The chain was very rusty and a few links would not bend at all. Cleaning and oiling didn't help any. The new chain, however, is quite smooth.

.. [#size] Even though I did tell them the size. Oh, well...
